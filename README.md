# FOMC Speech Summarization
This project has taught me a signficant amount about webscraping, including the tools involved and how to read HTML.

The objective of this project is to employ open source transformer models that will summarize FOMC member speeches for the purpose of making economic insights more accessible.

This project is intended to be split into two main stages:
 - **Data Retrieval:** This is done via webscraping in Python, using BeautifulSoup and Selenium.
 - **Text Summarization (incomplete):** This is intended to be done using transformers from HuggingFace. A significant limitation has been my lack of computing power. My computer can effectively only execute tasks on the CPU, meaning any models I am able to import and run will not be very robust. I am looking into solutions, including the use of virtual machines and external GPUs.
